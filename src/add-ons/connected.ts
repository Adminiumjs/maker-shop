/**
 * THE ADD-ONS ADMINIUM HAS FOR THIS STUDIO, LOADED FROM ADMINIUM.
 *
 * On a real install the studio is served by Adminium (`build:surface:staff`)
 * and DHL Shipping's client half is too: this file asks Adminium which
 * add-ons are attached to Maker Shop and switched on, fetches each one's
 * client bundle from Adminium, checks its bytes, imports it and registers
 * it. Its dispatch flow then books with the carrier through the add-on's
 * SERVER half, where the account's credentials are. `registry.ts` is the
 * other source: the vendored client half the DEMO build compiles in, which
 * answers from its demo carrier in the page. The seam (`host.ts`'s
 * `createRegistry`) is the same for both; only where the add-ons come from
 * differs.
 *
 * ── THIS FILE SENDS, AND IT IS DECLARED ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `sources.test.ts` bans naming `fetch` and an `import()` of anything but a
 * relative literal. Both bans are right, and both are lifted for this file
 * alone, by name, there: it asks the Adminium that served the page (the same
 * origin, the session's cookie riding along) and nothing else, and it imports
 * a bundle only from a URL on that origin under the add-on bundle path
 * (`bundleUrlIsSafe`). `connected.test.ts` drives the refusals, including the
 * URLs that look same-origin and are not.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE INTEGRITY CHECK IS WORTH ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each bundle arrives with a `sha256-…` the server recorded when it unpacked
 * the package. This fetches the bytes, hashes them and refuses a mismatch, then
 * imports the same URL (the HTTP cache makes the second read the first's bytes).
 * That proves the bytes match the reply that described them; it proves nothing
 * about a compromised server, which would describe its own bytes correctly.
 * The control against a bad package is the server's, at unpack and on every
 * read. It is not SRI: a dynamic `import()` cannot be held to an `integrity`.
 *
 * ── REACT FIRST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A built add-on bundle imports no `react`: it reads the host's React from a
 * well-known global, when its module initialises. So `installAddOnRuntime`
 * runs before the first `import()`, once; two Reacts on one page would argue
 * over one DOM tree.
 *
 * ── THE KEY IS THE ONE THE SERVER NAMED ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The key an add-on registers under selects its settings and which fills are
 * attributed to it, so a bundle served as one add-on that registers as another
 * is dropped with a problem rather than registered.
