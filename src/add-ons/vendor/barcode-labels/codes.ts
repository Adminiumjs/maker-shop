/**
 * THE ADD-ON'S OWN MAPPING TABLE, AND THE TWO THINGS IT REFUSES.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHERE A CODE LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT ON THE HOST'S RECORD
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `SettingsPanelPayload.patch` writes THE ADD-ON'S OWN VALUES. There is no slot
 * in the closed registry that lets an add-on add a column to a host's table,
 * and there should not be: a shop that removed this add-on would be left with a
 * column nothing maintains, in a table it did not design.
 *
 * So the map from a catalogue row to its barcode lives here, under this
 * add-on's own settings key, and the HOST reads it through `codeFor` at
 * whatever mount site wants it. That is the same arrangement `holiday-calendars`
 * uses for its day-sets, applied to a lookup instead of a list: the add-on says
 * what it knows in its own shape, and the host says what that means in its.
 *
 * ── AND THE KEY IT IS INDEXED BY IS THE HOST'S, WHICH IS THE SEAM ──────────
 *
 * A row is named by the host's own stable key for the thing it sells —
 * `CatalogueSample.key` on the settings surface, `RecordActionsPayload.recordId`
 * on the record one. This add-on never looks inside a record to work out which
 * row it is holding, and the reason is written at length in
 * `@adminium/add-on-host`'s `payloads.ts`: `recordId` exists precisely because
 * `id`, `ref`, `number` and `code` are all in use as the identity field across
 * the fifteen apps, and an add-on guessing between them is one shop's layout
 * leaking in by the back door.
 *
 * THE HONEST LIMIT OF THAT, SAID HERE AND SAID AGAIN ON SCREEN: this add-on
 * cannot check that the two namespaces meet. A host that mounts the record
 * surface on a screen whose `recordId` is not a catalogue key will find that
 * nothing it assigned in the settings form is ever found. There is no field on
 * either payload that would let the add-on notice, so instead of guessing it
 * NAMES THE KEY IT LOOKED UP in the empty state — an operator who sees a key
 * they do not recognise knows immediately what has happened, which is the most
 * an add-on on this seam can honestly do.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE TWO REFUSALS (25 D10)
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Both are refusals by a REAL RULE with a REAL FIX, and both exist because the
 * thing they prevent fails silently at a till rather than loudly here.
 *
 * ── ONE: THE CHECK DIGIT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An EAN-13 carries its own checksum in its last digit. A thirteen-digit number
 * whose last digit is wrong is not a slightly-wrong barcode — it is not a
 * barcode: a scanner computes the check for itself and reports nothing at all,
 * so the label prints, looks right, goes on the box, and the failure surfaces
 * weeks later at somebody's counter with no clue attached.
 *
 * It is also the most fixable error there is, which is what makes it worth
 * refusing rather than warning about: this package knows exactly which digit
 * the first twelve demand, so the refusal NAMES IT. "The last digit should be
 * 7" is a refusal an operator clears in one keystroke.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IS SILENTLY CORRECT IT. A number a shop typed is a number
 * a shop believes it owns; changing the last digit for them would hand back a
 * different article number from the one on their own paperwork, and they would
 * have no way to tell. The whole value of the refusal is that a person looks at
 * the two numbers.
 *
 * ── TWO: TWO ROWS, ONE CODE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A barcode is an identity. Two rows carrying the same one is not a duplicate
 * record — it is an AMBIGUITY, and it is resolved at the till by whichever row
 * the shop's own lookup happens to find first. That is the same class of
 * collision `holiday-calendars` refuses when an imported holiday lands on a day
 * somebody wrote in by hand, and it is refused here for the same reason: the
 * add-on is not entitled to pick, and picking silently is the worst of the
 * available behaviours.
 *
 * So the refusal names THE ROW THAT ALREADY HOLDS THE CODE, and the fix is to
 * change one of the two.
 *
 * IT COMPARES THE CODE TEXT AND IGNORES THE SYMBOLOGY, which is the part worth
 * reading twice. A scanner hands the till a string of characters and does not
 * say which symbology it came off; `5901234123457` drawn as an EAN-13 and the
 * same digits drawn as a Code 128 arrive identical. Comparing the pair
 * `(symbology, code)` would have let those two coexist and would have been
 * exactly wrong.
 *
 * ── AND WHAT IS *NOT* A COLLISION, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT KEEPS IT USABLE ──
 *
 * GIVING A ROW THE CODE IT ALREADY HAS. Re-assigning is how an operator changes
 * the symbology, or re-types a number to check it; refusing against the row's
 * own current code would make the form refuse the state it is already in. So
 * the duplicate check looks at OTHER rows only, and a re-assignment replaces.
 *
 * GIVING A ROW A DIFFERENT CODE. A row holds exactly one code — the second
 * assignment replaces the first rather than accumulating, which is what makes
 * the table idempotent under repeated pressing of one button.
