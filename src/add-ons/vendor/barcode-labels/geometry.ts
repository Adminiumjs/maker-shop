/**
 * THE PAPER: what a sheet of these labels is, in millimetres.
 *
 * ── WHY THE NUMBERS ARE HERE AND NOT IN THE RENDERER ───────────────────────
 *
 * Two modules need them and would otherwise each carry a copy. `sheet.ts` lays
 * a symbol out on a label, and `codes.ts` caps how long a Code 128 code may be
 * — and that cap is not a taste: it is the longest code whose bars still fit
 * this label at a width a scanner can read. Written twice, the two would
 * disagree the first time somebody changed the label size, and the visible
 * result would be a form that accepts a code and a sheet that draws it too
 * narrow to scan. Nothing would be red. So there is one set of numbers and both
 * derive from it.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE LAYOUT IS DESCRIBED RATHER THAN NAMED ──────────────────────
 *
 * There is a very common label sheet with these measurements, and this file
 * does not say whose it is, because 24 D12 forbids naming a company and a
 * stationery reference is a company's catalogue number. What is written down
 * instead is the geometry itself — the label size, the grid, the margins — so a
 * shop can hold a sheet against it and see whether it is the one they have.
 * That is more useful than a name anyway: a name only helps somebody who buys
 * that name.
 *
 * ── THE ONE NUMBER THAT IS A STANDARD AND NOT A CHOICE ─────────────────────
 *
 * `MIN_MODULE_MM`. Everything else here could be a different sheet tomorrow;
 * that one is the narrowest module either symbology may be drawn at and still
 * be scannable at an ordinary till, and it is the floor the Code 128 cap is
 * computed against. Lowering it to fit a longer code would be trading a limit
 * somebody can work around — "your reference is too long for this label" — for
 * a barcode that reads four times out of five, which is the worse of the two by
 * a wide margin. An intermittent barcode gets blamed on the scanner.
