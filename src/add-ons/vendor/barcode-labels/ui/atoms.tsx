 * a second app hosted the same slot, and this one claims two.
 *
 * CSS LOGICAL PROPERTIES ONLY — `padding-inline`, `inset-inline-start`,
 * `border-block-end`. The host renders Arabic right-to-left with no RTL
 * stylesheet, so a physical `left` here is a bug that only one of eight locales
 * would ever show. `sources.test.ts` greps for the physical spellings.
 *
 * COPIED, NOT SHARED, and that is the same decision the host mirror and the `t`
 * seam make: this repository publishes each add-on standalone and there is no
 * package sitting between them. Five copies of a button is a cost; a shared
 * runtime dependency an add-on's host does not have is a D7 violation.

 *
 * Because almost everything on those surfaces is somebody else's text. A row
 * key is the host's; a number is the shop's; and both are written in Latin
 * digits on an Arabic page, because a barcode is Latin digits — the label will
 * print them that way whatever language the screen is in, and a check digit
 * transliterated into Arabic-Indic could not be matched against the number in
 * the box above it.
 *
 * `dir="auto"` rather than `"ltr"` because the direction genuinely depends on
 * the characters — a host's row key may be written in any script — and "auto"
 * says whose text it is instead of guessing which way it runs.
 *
 * It is the marker a host's numeral guard reads, which is why it is NOT applied
 * to the counts this add-on works out for itself: marking those would quiet the
 * guard by lying to it.

/**
 * THE SYMBOL, ON SCREEN, from the very modules the sheet is drawn from.
 *
 * ── WHY A PREVIEW EXISTS AT ALL ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the alternative is a button that produces a file somebody has to open
 * to find out whether it was right. The one failure this add-on has to make
 * impossible is a label that looks fine and scans as something else, and the
 * cheapest guard against it is letting a person see the bars beside the number
 * before they print two hundred of them.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT SHARES `runsOf` WITH THE PDF ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A preview drawn from a second encoding would be a preview of a different
 * barcode, which is worse than none: it would look like confirmation. This
 * takes the same `Modules` string `sheet.ts` takes, through the same run
 * collapser, so the only thing that differs between the screen and the paper is
 * the unit. `record-action.test.tsx` asserts the rect count on screen equals the
 * dark-run count of the encoding.
 *
 * `shapeRendering="crispEdges"` because a barcode is the one graphic where
 * anti-aliasing is a defect rather than a nicety: a half-lit pixel column at a
 * bar edge is exactly what a camera decoder reads as a narrower bar.
 *
 * IT IS `aria-hidden` AND CARRIES NO LABEL, which is the right answer rather
 * than a gap. The number is rendered as text immediately beside it, in every
 * place this is used, so a screen reader announcing the bars as well would read
 * the same thing twice — and there is no useful third thing to say about a
 * picture of a number that is already on the page.
