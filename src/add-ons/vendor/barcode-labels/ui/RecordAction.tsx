/**
 * THE FIRST FILL OF `record.actions` — a sheet of labels for the row in front
 * of you.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS SURFACE IS THE SHAPE THE SLOT WAS BOUGHT FOR
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The closed registry's entry for this id describes it as one opening, on the
 * screen where somebody is already looking at ONE record, to do a thing to it —
 * and then records that it ships unfilled, because the wave-6 add-on that could
 * have filled it turned out not to need it. `payloads.ts` repeats the
 * consequence: a reader will not find a fill by grepping.
 *
 * Printing labels for one catalogue row is that sentence with nothing left
 * over. The person is on the row's screen because the row is what they are
 * dealing with; the thing they want is a sheet of stickers for it; and there is
 * no other screen in either host where that request makes sense, because a
 * sheet of labels is FOR a row and a list of rows is not a row.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `patchRecord` IS NEVER CALLED, AND THAT IS A DECISION WITH AN ARGUMENT
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The payload carries an OPTIONAL write handle, and its own comment sets out
 * the reason for the optionality: hosts genuinely differ on whether an add-on
 * may write back, and the dossier the slot was bought against splits down the
 * middle — rendering an invoice to a file writes nothing to the invoice, while
 * logging a call onto a deal is nothing but a write.
 *
 * THIS ADD-ON IS SQUARELY IN THE FIRST HALF, and it does not merely happen to
 * be: the alternative was considered and refused. The obvious write is to stamp
 * the number onto the record so the shop's own list can show it — and to do
 * that this add-on would have to choose a FIELD NAME. `barcode`? `ean`? `code`?
 * Nothing on this payload says what the shop calls that column, or whether it
 * has one, and picking one would be this add-on inventing a host's schema. That
 * is `payloads.ts`'s founding mistake in the other direction: one shop's
 * vocabulary pushed into every host through the only door that was open.
 *
 * So the number lives where it belongs — in this add-on's own table, reachable
 * through `codeFor` at any mount site the host likes — the record is READ and
 * never written, and the screen says so in
 * `addon.barcode-labels.record.readOnly`.
 *
 * THE PAYOFF IS THAT THE ABSENCE COSTS NOTHING. An add-on that wanted the
 * handle would have to render one screen when it has one and a different, worse
 * screen when it does not. This one renders the same screen either way, in
 * every host of the surface, which is the strongest form the optionality can be
 * honoured in — and `record-action.test.tsx` renders it both ways and asserts
 * the markup is identical, so a future edit that reached for the handle turns
 * that case red.
 *
 * ── AND `record` IS UNUSED, WHICH IS ALSO THE POINT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The payload hands over the whole record and this component reads none of it.
 * What it needs is `recordId` — the host's own answer to "which row is this" —
 * and `now`, the shop's own day. Reaching into `record` to find a better key,
 * or a name to print on the sticker, would be sniffing a layout that differs in
 * every app: `id`, `ref`, `number` and `code` are all in use as the identity
 * field across the fifteen apps, which is exactly why `recordId` exists.
