/**
 * EAN-13, WRITTEN OUT.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS HAND-ROLLED AND NOT A DEPENDENCY ───────────────────────────
 *
 * 25 D11: an add-on takes no runtime dependency the host has not already got.
 * The host has React and nothing else, so a barcode library is not available to
 * this package at any price — and the whole symbology is a lookup table, a
 * weighted sum and a fixed guard pattern. `shipping-dhl` writes a PDF by hand
 * for the same reason and in about the same number of lines.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE, WHICH IS FIXED AND WORTH KNOWING BEFORE READING THE CODE ────
 *
 * Thirteen digits become ninety-five modules, always:
 *
 *     101                  the start guard, 3 modules
 *     six digits × 7       the left half, 42 modules
 *     01010                the centre guard, 5 modules
 *     six digits × 7       the right half, 42 modules
 *     101                  the end guard, 3 modules
 *
 * That is twelve digits drawn. THE FIRST DIGIT IS NOT DRAWN AT ALL, which is
 * the fact that surprises everybody who meets this symbology for the first
 * time and the reason the tables below are shaped as they are. It is carried by
 * WHICH of two alphabets each of the six left-hand digits is written in: the
 * L set or the G set, in a pattern the first digit selects. A scanner reads the
 * six left digits, notices the pattern of alphabets it had to use to read them,
 * and looks the first digit up from that.
 *
 * A corollary that matters when reading `sheet.ts`: the first digit has nowhere
 * of its own under the bars, so it is printed to the LEFT of the whole symbol,
 * in the quiet zone. That is not decoration — it is where the standard puts it.
 *
 * ── THE THREE ALPHABETS ARE ONE TABLE WITH TWO DERIVATIONS ─────────────────
 *
 * They are written out separately below because a reference prints them
 * separately and a reader checking this package against one should be able to
 * compare line for line. They are not independent, and `ean13.test.ts` asserts
 * both relations rather than trusting the transcription:
 *
 *     R[d] is L[d] with every module flipped
 *     G[d] is R[d] backwards
 *
 * A single mistyped digit in any of the thirty entries breaks at least one of
 * those, which is what turns three hand-copied tables into three checked ones.
 * Every entry also has exactly two bars and two spaces, and every L entry has
 * an odd number of dark modules where every G and R entry has an even number —
 * that parity is the mechanism the paragraph above describes, stated as an
 * assertion.
