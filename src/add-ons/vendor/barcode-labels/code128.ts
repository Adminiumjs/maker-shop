/**
 * CODE 128, SET B, WRITTEN OUT.
 *
 * ── WHY SET B AND ONLY SET B ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Code 128 has three character sets and can switch between them mid-symbol: A
 * carries control characters and upper case, B carries the printable ASCII a
 * keyboard produces, C packs two digits into one symbol character and halves
 * the width of a long run of them. A general encoder chooses between them per
 * character and is a small optimiser.
 *
 * This one does not, and the reason is what an add-on is for rather than
 * laziness. What a shop types into the form in `ui/SettingsPanel.tsx` is a
 * catalogue reference it already uses on its own paperwork — `ADM-4417`,
 * `WAL-COAST-06` — and every character of every such reference is in set B. Set
 * C would save modules only on a code that is all digits, and a code that is
 * all digits and thirteen long is an EAN-13, which this add-on already draws
 * correctly at a size a scanner expects. Set A buys nothing at all: a control
 * character in a catalogue reference is not a thing.
 *
 * So the encoder is one set, no shifts, no switches, and the code is short
 * enough to be read against a published table. THE COST IS STATED WHERE IT IS
 * FELT: a code with a character set B has no symbol for is REFUSED, in words,
 * by `codes.ts`, naming the character. An encoder that silently dropped it
 * would put a barcode on a label that scans as a different reference from the
 * one printed underneath it.
 *
 * ── THE SHAPE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     start B              11 modules
 *     one per character    11 modules each
 *     checksum             11 modules
 *     stop                 13 modules
 *
 * Every symbol character is eleven modules wide and is written as SIX WIDTHS —
 * bar, space, bar, space, bar, space — summing to eleven. The stop pattern is
 * the exception and carries a seventh element, a final bar two modules wide,
 * which is why it is thirteen.
 *
 * ── THE TABLE IS CHECKED RATHER THAN TRUSTED ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A hundred and seven six-digit strings is exactly the kind of thing that gets
 * one character wrong in transcription, and a wrong pattern draws a symbol that
 * scans as a different character with no visible sign. `code128.test.ts`
 * therefore asserts three structural facts of the published table, every one of
 * which a typo breaks:
 *
 *   · every pattern is six widths summing to eleven;
 *   · the three BAR widths of every pattern sum to an EVEN number — this is the
 *     self-checking property the symbology is built on, and it holds for all
 *     107 entries and for no accidental value;
 *   · all 107 are distinct, so no two characters draw alike.
 *
 * Those three together will not catch a swap of two whole valid patterns, so
 * the suite also pins a published encoding end to end — see its own header.
 */
