/**
 * A message lookup, and the reason it exists rather than a hook from the host.
 *
 * A slot fill is handed a payload and nothing else. It cannot import the host's
 * `useT` — that would be a runtime dependency on the host's module graph, which
 * 24 D7 does not allow — so it has to work out the reader's language for
 * itself. The one thing the host guarantees is `<html lang>`, stamped by its
 * i18n provider; this module reads that attribute and re-renders when it moves.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` over a `MutationObserver` rather than reading the
 * attribute during render: the host sets `lang` in an effect, so a plain read
 * would be one render behind on every language switch and both surfaces would
 * sit in the old language until something else moved.
 *
 * This is the fifth copy of this seam in the repository and it is a copy on
 * purpose — see `@adminium/add-on-host`'s own header. What is NOT copied is the
 * rule about digits: `describeNumerals` lives in the shared mirror and is run
 * against this seam by `numerals.test.ts`, because three of four add-ons
 * shipped the same digit defect independently.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS COPY LEAVES OUT, AND IT IS A WHOLE SECTION ───────────────────
 *
 * There is no date formatter here, and the four siblings all have one. This
 * add-on renders exactly one date — the day printed at the foot of a label —
 * and it renders it as the ISO day it arrived as, because the label is drawn in
 * base-14 Helvetica and has a Latin alphabet and nothing else (see `sheet.ts`).
 * A localised date on a sticker whose reader might be anywhere is also the
 * wrong thing: `05/08/2026` is two different days depending on who picks the
 * box up, and `2026-08-05` is one day everywhere.
 *
 * The consequence is that this package builds no `Date` at all, anywhere —
 * which `sources.test.ts` asserts, and which is a stronger statement than the
 * "only at the formatting seam" the sibling packages can make.

 * Pure lookup with `{placeholder}` substitution — no plurals, by design.

 * line is what decides whether an Arabic reader sees ٢٤ or 24. Three of the
 * four add-ons that existed before this one shipped the same defect at the same
 * seam, in copy sitting next to host strings that were formatted correctly;
 * fixing it here rather than at each call site fixes the call sites nobody has
 * written yet.
 *
 * A caller that has ALREADY formatted its value passes a STRING and is left
 * alone. That is not only for money and clock faces — it is how this package
 * renders the one figure that must NOT be transliterated: see below.
 *
 * ── THE DIGITS THIS ADD-ON MUST NOT TOUCH ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A barcode number is an IDENTIFIER, and so is a single digit OF one. When the
 * check-digit refusal says which digit the last place should hold, that digit
 * has to be readable against the number the operator has just typed into the
 * box above it — which is in Latin digits, because both symbologies are, and
 * because the label will print it in Latin digits whatever language the screen
 * is in.
 *
 * So it is passed as a STRING and this function leaves it alone, and the panel
 * renders it inside the `Typed` atom, whose `dir="auto"` is the marker a host's
 * Arabic-page numeral guard reads as "somebody else's text". That is the same
 * arrangement `holiday-calendars` uses for a year and `shipping-dhl` for a
 * clock face: the rule "format every number" has its exceptions handled by
 * formatting DIFFERENTLY, never by quietly not formatting.
 *
 * Everything that is genuinely a COUNT — how many labels, how many sheets, how
 * many characters a font cannot draw — goes through as a number and is
 * formatted.
