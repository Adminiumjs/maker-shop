/**
 * THE LABEL SHEET: a real PDF, assembled byte by byte.
 *
 * ── WHY BY HAND ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 25 D11 again: no runtime dependency the host has not got, and the host has
 * React. `packages/shipping-dhl/src/label.ts` writes a complete PDF 1.4 in
 * about twenty-five lines with nothing at all, and this is the same file with
 * more pages and rectangles instead of only text. Six object kinds, offsets
 * collected while they are concatenated so the cross-reference table is exact,
 * and the two base-14 fonts every reader already has.
 *
 * ── THE WHOLE TRICK IS `re` AND `f` ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A bar is a filled rectangle. `x y w h re` adds one to the current path and
 * `f` fills it, so a barcode is a fill colour, a run of `re`s and one `f`. No
 * image, no font, nothing embedded, and the result is vector — which is what
 * makes it scan: a bitmap barcode at the wrong resolution has bar edges that
 * land between printer dots, and that is the classic reason a printed label
 * reads on one machine and not the next.
 *
 * ── DETERMINISM, WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT AND NOT AN AESTHETIC ───────────────
 *
 * The same facts must give the same bytes, or `sheet.test.ts` cannot assert a
 * document at all. So:
 *
 *   NO CLOCK. There is no `/CreationDate` and nothing here reads one. The day
 *   printed on the label arrives as `on` — the SHOP's own day, off the host's
 *   `ShopClock` — which is a value passed in and not a machine being asked. The
 *   distinction is the one `@adminium/add-on-host`'s `payloads.ts` makes at
 *   length: a clock is a host fact, and an add-on that dated a document off its
 *   own would be dating it off somebody else's Tuesday.
 *
 *   NO DICE, so no object identifiers, no random names, nothing generated.
 *
 *   EVERY NUMBER FORMATTED THE SAME WAY. `mm()` puts every coordinate through
 *   the same two-decimal conversion, so a value that happens to land on an
 *   integer is written `12.00` like all the others rather than `12`.
 *
 * ── AND THE TEXT IS LATIN, WHICH IS A LIMIT AND IS SAID OUT LOUD ───────────
 *
 * The fonts are Helvetica and Helvetica-Bold, two of the fourteen every PDF
 * reader is required to have. Not embedding a font is what keeps this bundle
 * from carrying a megabyte of glyphs and what keeps the sheet openable
 * anywhere — and the price is that the alphabet is Latin. A row reference
 * written in another script has no glyphs here.
 *
 * SO IT IS DROPPED RATHER THAN GUESSED AT, AND THE COUNT IS RETURNED. Emitting
 * the bytes anyway would put whatever a reader's default encoding made of them
 * on the sticker; substituting a question mark would be this add-on inventing
 * somebody's reference. `latinOnly` says how many characters it could not draw,
 * both surfaces print that sentence, and the barcode itself is unaffected —
 * bars are rectangles and have no alphabet.

 * columns of figures line up — which is the one metric that can be stated in a
 * line and is true of all ten characters it is used for. The digit groups under
 * an EAN-13 are centred with it, because their position under the halves of the
 * symbol is part of the symbology's own layout.
 *
 * EVERYTHING ELSE IS LEFT-ALIGNED, and that is the decision rather than a
 * shortcoming: the reference and the day sit against the label's inner edge,
