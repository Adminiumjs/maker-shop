/**
 * What the host gets when it registers this add-on.
 *
 * One function returning one plain object. No side effects at import time, no
 * global registration, no reaching into the host: the host asks, the add-on
 * answers, and everything the host needs to draw a shelf row and two surfaces
 * is in the value it gets back.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated where somebody would come looking to widen it (24 §7): this
 * gives a catalogue row a number, checks that the number is well formed, and
 * draws a sheet of labels for one row. It is not a stock system, not a till,
 * not a numbering authority and not a scanner. The last of those is the one
 * worth naming, because it is what everybody assumes an add-on called this
 * would do — see the header on the record fill below.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS OBJECT LEAVES OUT, AND WHY EACH ABSENCE IS A DECISION ────────
 *
 * `demoSwitch` — absent. It exists so a credentialled add-on can offer "use a
 * stand-in instead of calling the real service" (24 D11). Nothing here calls
 * anything, so there is nothing to stand in for, and a switch offering to
 * disable a call that does not happen would be a lie in the connect dialog.
 *
 * `applySettings` — absent. Every engine in this package takes the values as an
 * ARGUMENT — `codeFor(values, sku)`, `assignCode(current, …)` — so there is no
 * module-level copy to keep in step, no push to miss, and no state that can be
 * one change behind what the shop last saved. A host that never calls
 * `applySettings` is not a host this add-on can be stale in.
 *
 * `permissions` — empty. It is what connecting LETS the add-on do, shown as
 * ticked rows before a shop agrees. This one reads one record it is handed,
 * writes no host record and reaches nowhere; the honest length of that list is
 * zero, and inventing a row so the dialog looked substantial would be asking
 * for a power to reassure somebody.
 *
 * `settings` — empty, which is NOT the same as storing nothing. `AddOn.settings`
 * is what the HOST's manage panel may render, and the host can only draw the
 * controls its vocabulary knows: a switch, a time, a text box, a multi-select.
 * What this add-on stores is a table of rows and their numbers, which is none
 * of those, and it is edited in `settings.add-on.panel` — the slot that exists
 * precisely so an add-on can own a form the host could not describe.
 * `manifest.json` still declares the key as a `json` setting, because an
 * installer should be able to see everything a package will write.

 *
 * `codeFor(values, sku)` answers "what number does this row carry", and
