 * THE SHOPPER'S SURFACE — what replaces the plain note field (24 D19).

 * Comp L's screen 2, and the whole reason the add-on exists: a preview that
 * redraws on every keystroke with no "apply" button, one input group per area
 * the maker drew, and — the part that is hardest and matters most — CONSTRAINT
 * FEEDBACK THAT IS SPECIFIC. A red border alone is not feedback. When a line
 * overruns, the area outlines in `--danger`, a sentence beneath says exactly
 * what is wrong with a number in it, and BOTH ways out are buttons that carry
 * their own numbers: set it at N millimetres, or shorten it to N characters.
 *
 * Those numbers come from the engine (`fit` in `template.ts`), never from this
 * file, and a verdict cannot reach here without them — the contract's failing
 * branch requires `remedies` and the conformance suite asserts one is a number.
 * That is criterion 18 turned into two buttons.
 *
 * THREE RULES OF ITS OWN, from comp L, and each is one line of CSS or one line
 * here rather than a paragraph: it updates on every keystroke; the redraw never
 * moves the page or resizes the canvas (`contain: layout paint`, a fixed
 * canvas box); and on a narrow viewport the picture pins to the top while the
 * inputs scroll under it.
