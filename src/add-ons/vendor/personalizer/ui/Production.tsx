/**
 * WHAT GOES TO THE MACHINE — comp L's screen 5, and the payoff.
 *
 * The piece's outline as a cut path, the personalization as filled paths, the
 * layers colour-coded and listed with each one's length or area in millimetres,
 * the material and the finished size, and a download.
 *
 * TWO HONEST LINES SHIP HERE AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING. The first is the one
 * 24 §8B quotes verbatim — "This is a file, not a machine — send it to your
 * laser the way you always do" — because this add-on stops at the file and D5c
 * says so. The second says what the letters in it are: the studio's own cut
 * alphabet, at exactly the size and place the customer's picture shows. A
 * reader who compares the two side by side will notice the letterforms differ,
 * and being told why by the interface is better than working it out.
 *
 * The file is offered as a download through a `blob:` URL built from bytes this
 * package computed. That is not a network call — nothing leaves the browser and
 * nothing is fetched (24 D11); `sources.test.ts` greps this file for `fetch`
 * along with everything else.
