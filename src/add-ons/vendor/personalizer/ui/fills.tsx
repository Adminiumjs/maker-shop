// FOUR PAYLOAD INTERFACES USED TO BE DECLARED HERE, and declaring them here was
// the defect rather than the tidy choice it was argued to be. The rule they
// were written to — "a type an add-on only READS may be narrowed, so it lives
// with the add-on" — is sound about OWNERSHIP and silent about SHAPE, and the
// shape is what a second host changes. So what got written down was not "the
// fields I read" but "the fields the one host I was built against happened to
// send": `product.key`, `config.note`, `patchConfig`, `line.productKey` — a
// maker studio's basket line, as particular to Birch Row as `SampleJob` was to
// the print works, and just as invisible until somebody mounted it elsewhere.
//
// They are the shared registry's now, one per slot id, named for the surface.
// Narrowing is still allowed and still safe — `render` is contravariant in its
// payload, so a component that reads fewer fields is assignable — but the
// narrowing is now checked against a shape both hosts promise instead of
// against one host's memory.

/**
 * WHAT ONE LINE WAS PERSONALIZED WITH — the same two steps everywhere.

 * asked `recall`, then `lineFor(payload.order.ref)` — an ORDER reference handed
 * to a function matching LINE ids, so that branch could not match under any
 * data — and then `fromNote`. The proof asked nobody at all: the host drew its
 * own material tile and criterion 17's three pictures were two.
 *
 * Two steps, in this order, and no host-specific field in either:
 *
 *   1. `recall(key, note)` — the shopper configured it in this session, so the
 *      font, size and finish they actually chose are known.
 *   2. `fromNote(key, note)` — they did not, or it was ordered before this
 *      add-on was ever connected. The words are still on the line, because the
 *      words live in the HOST's own note field (D16), so they are laid into the
 *      areas the maker drew and everything else falls back to the piece's own
 *      defaults. That is a true statement about that order rather than an
 *      invented one.
 *

 * THE NOTE FIELD, KEPT — for every piece the maker has not drawn areas on yet.

 *
 * `product.options.personalize` is a `single` slot: while a fill is mounted the
 * host's own block is gone, and the host's own block is a finished thing (D19) —
 * a note field, a live counter against the shop's limit, and the promise that a
 * picture comes back before anything is cut. Two of Birch Row's twelve pieces
 * have a template. On the other ten this fill rendered one sentence and NO
 * INPUT, so a shopper who could type "Sam & Jo, 2019" onto a keyring with the
 * add-on off could type nothing at all with it on. Driven and confirmed in the
 * DOM for all twelve.
 *
 * That inverts what an add-on is for. D19 says the arrival of one is a visible
 * gain in capability rather than the repair of a broken page, and there is no
 * reading of "gain" under which a working field becomes a paragraph.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FALLBACK RATHER THAN A TEMPLATE PER PIECE ───────────────────────
 *
 * Drawing areas on the other ten would fix these twelve and not the thirteenth.
 * A host's catalogue is the HOST's, this add-on ships two templates as seed data
 * for a demo, and a shop that adds a piece tomorrow must not lose its note field
 * for the afternoon between adding it and drawing on it. The floor is the
 * behaviour the host already had; the template is the upgrade on top of it.
 *
 * `noteLimit` comes off the payload because it is the HOST's limit — the words
 * go back into the host's own field (D16), and an add-on that let a shopper type
 * more than the shop can store would be filling a column that truncates. A host
 * that caps nothing passes nothing and the counter is not drawn.
 *
 * `surfaces.test.tsx` walks a piece with a template, a piece without, and a key
 * this add-on has never heard of, and asserts a NAMED writable field on each —
 * so a thirteenth piece cannot silently lose it.
