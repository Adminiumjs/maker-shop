/**
 * The pieces every surface here is built from.
 *
 * `Preview` is the interesting one: it renders the ENGINE'S OWN BYTES. The
 * shopper's canvas, the basket thumbnail, the maker's sample and the proof all
 * pass the same personalization through `drawPreview` — which is `previewSvg`
 * plus filing the result under its digest — and set the resulting string as
 * HTML. So "the cart thumbnail, the proof and the order line are the same
 * picture" is not three renderers agreeing: there is one renderer, it produces
 * text, and the same text is what the digest is taken over (criterion 17).
 *
 * `LinePicture` is the second half of that. One renderer is not enough on its
 * own — three surfaces calling it with three different `widthPx` values produce
 * three different strings and three different digests — so the three surfaces
 * criterion 17 names go through a component with NO options to pass.
 *
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` IS THE POINT AND IS SAFE HERE, which is a sentence
 * that deserves the two lines it takes to justify. Everything a shopper types
 * goes through `esc()` in `template.ts` before it reaches the markup —
 * `template.test.ts` asserts that with `<b>&"Row"`, and `nameSvg` escapes the
 * accessible name through the same function — and the rest of the string is
 * geometry this package computed. Rebuilding the same SVG as JSX would give
 * React a tree to diff and would give us TWO renderers to keep byte-identical,
 * which is exactly the thing the criterion is about.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THE SCREEN HAS THAT THE FILE DOES NOT IS THE NAME. `previews`
 * holds the picture; the DOM holds the picture plus an `aria-label` and a
 * `<title>` in the reader's language. That difference is deliberate and is the
 * subject of `nameSvg`'s header: a file id must not change because a shopper
 * switched language.
