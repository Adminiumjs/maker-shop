/**
 * HOW PERSONALIZING WORKS — the page a shopper reads before they trust a box.
 *
 * ── WHY IT SHIPS WITH THE ADD-ON RATHER THAN WITH THE SHOP ─────────────────
 *
 * Every sentence in it is about THIS FEATURE: that the box is the piece, that
 * an overrun is answered with two numbers rather than a shrug, that a picture
 * comes back before anything is cut, and that the words reach the laser as
 * outlines. A shop with no personalizer connected has none of that to explain,
 * and a shop that connects one should not have to write the explanation in
 * eight languages. So it comes with the thing it describes and leaves with it.
 *
 * ── WHY A DISCLOSURE AND NOT A PAGE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Comp L makes it a full shopper page with its own route. The add-on contract
 * has no shopper-side route to take — `nav.add-on.routes` is the maker's shell
 * — and inventing one would mean the host keeping a list of an add-on's pages.
 * It opens in place instead, directly under the surface it is about, which is
 * also where the question is actually asked. Recorded as a bracket amendment
 * against 24 §8B.
 *
 * Closed by default, because a shopper who is happy typing should not have to
 * scroll past an essay, and `<details>` rather than a hand-rolled toggle so it
 * is keyboard-operable and announced as a disclosure without any of our code.
