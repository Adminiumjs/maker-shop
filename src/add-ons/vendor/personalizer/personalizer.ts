/**
 * `product-personalizer@1`, implemented.
 *
 * The contract is five methods and this file is the whole of them. Everything
 * they do is in `template.ts`; what lives here is the seam — turning the
 * engine's pure results into the shapes the host stores and hands around, and
 * holding the two little stores the host will one day replace with tables.
 *
 * ── THE STORES ARE MAPS, AND THAT IS THE SEAM ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `render` returns a `PreviewRef` — a file id — and `productionFile` returns a
 * `FileRef`. In a real install both are rows in the host's file store, written
 * through `files:write`, which is the one write scope this add-on asks for. In
 * the demo they are two `Map`s keyed by the content digest, and every surface
 * that wants the actual bytes asks for them by id. The seam does not change
 * when the store does; only where `bytes.get(id)` reads from.
 *
 * KEYED BY DIGEST, NOT BY A COUNTER. Two identical personalizations produce one
 * entry, one id and one picture — which is criterion 17 expressed as storage
 * rather than as an assertion, and it is why the cart thumbnail and the proof
 * cannot drift apart even if the code that asked for them did.
 *
 * ── `open` RESOLVES THROUGH THE HOST ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The contract's `open` is a promise the shopper's surface settles. This add-on
 * is a set of slot fills rather than a modal it drives itself, so `open` hands
 * back a promise and the surface calls `settle` when the shopper presses "Use
 * this" or backs out. A headless caller — the conformance suite — gets the
 * initial personalization straight back, because there is nobody to ask.

 * THE OPTIONS THE THREE SURFACES OF CRITERION 17 DRAW WITH — one object, so

 * string it returns and `digestOf` hashes exactly those bytes, so a thumbnail
 * asked for at 184 and a proof asked for at 240 are two different pictures with
 * two different file ids — which is precisely what criterion 17 forbids across
 * the cart line, the proof and the order line. They therefore do not choose:
 * `LinePicture` in `ui/bits.tsx` takes no options at all and passes this, and
 * a surface that wants to show it larger scales the SVG with CSS, which changes
 * no byte.
 *
 * The shopper's editing canvas is deliberately NOT one of the three. It draws
 * at 520 with the maker's guides and the failing areas outlined, because it is
 * a different job — you are choosing there, not approving.

 * EVERY SURFACE IN THIS ADD-ON GOES THROUGH HERE, and until this repair that
 * sentence was in this header and was false: the four React surfaces all called
 * `previewSvg` directly, through `Preview` in `ui/bits.tsx`, so nothing they
 * drew was ever stored and the id that travelled on an order was written by a
 * different call than the one the shopper looked at. The two agreed only
 * because the same pure function sat under both — which is a coincidence of the
 * arguments, not an invariant, and criterion 17 rests on the invariant.
 *
 * `Preview` calls this now, so drawing a picture and filing it are one act. The
 * store is keyed by the DIGEST, so a re-render of unchanged values writes the
 * same entry it already held: the map is bounded by the number of distinct
 * pictures rather than by the number of renders.
