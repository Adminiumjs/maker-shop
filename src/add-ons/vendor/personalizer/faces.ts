/**
 * THE FIVE FACES THE STUDIO CUTS: what each one looks like, how wide its
 * letters are, and — for the file that goes to the laser — the outline of every
 * letter it can cut.
 *
 * ── WHY THE WIDTHS ARE A TABLE AND NOT A MEASUREMENT (24 D5c) ───────────────
 *
 * Comp L measures text with `document.createElement("canvas").getContext("2d")`
 * and `measureText`. D5c overrules that, and the reason is acceptance criterion
 * 17 rather than taste: canvas advances depend on the platform, on which fonts
 * happen to be installed, and on the browser's own fallback chain. A verdict
 * measured that way says "two characters more than fits" on one machine and
 * "it fits" on the next, the cart thumbnail and the proof stop being the same
 * picture, and none of it is reproducible in a headless suite. So the numbers
 * live HERE, committed, and the engine is a pure function of them.
 *
 * ── HOW THE NUMBERS WERE OBTAINED, EXACTLY ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Measured ONCE, by hand, and pasted in. `tools/measure-faces.html` is the page
 * that produced them and it ships in this package so anyone can reproduce or
 * revise the table: it sets `font = <weight> 1000px <stack>` on a 2D canvas and
 * reads `measureText(ch).width` for every printable ASCII character, then reads
 * `actualBoundingBoxAscent/Descent` off `H`, `x` and `Hgjy` for the cap height,
 * the x-height and the ink extents. Run it, copy the JSON, replace the arrays
 * below. It was run in Chrome on macOS on 2026-08-10.
 *
 * `advance` is therefore in PER MILLE OF THE TYPE SIZE, for ASCII 32…126 in
 * code order, and `cap`, `ink` and `xh` are per mille of the same size.
 *
 * ── AND WHY A STALE TABLE STILL CANNOT LIE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A committed table on a machine whose fonts differ would normally drift away
 * from what the browser actually draws, and the shopper would see a line
 * overflowing a zone the engine had just called a fit. It cannot, because the
 * preview does not ask the browser to lay the text out: every `<text>` the
 * surface draws carries `textLength` set to the width THIS TABLE computed, with
 * `lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs"`. The browser is told the answer. What the
 * table decides is what the reader sees, on every platform, in every locale —
 * and the production file below is placed from the same numbers, so the file
 * and the picture agree by construction rather than by luck.
 *
 * ── NO WEBFONT IS DOWNLOADED (24 D11) ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every `css` stack below is families a browser already has, ending in a
 * generic. A demo that fetched a font file would be a real third-party call in
 * an add-on whose whole claim is that it calls nothing.
 *
 * Face names are NAMES — Fenwick, Bramley, Row, Alder, Quarry — and names do
 * not translate, which is why they are not in the string bundle.
