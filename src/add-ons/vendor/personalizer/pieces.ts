/**
 * The pieces this add-on knows how to draw, and what they are made of.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE TEMPLATE. `Template` is the CONTRACT's shape
 * (`product-personalizer@1`): a product key, the angles the maker put up, and
 * the zones they drew on them. It deliberately says nothing about how big a
 * coaster is or what walnut looks like, because those belong to the shop's
 * catalogue and a contract that carried them could only ever describe one
 * shop's catalogue.
 *
 * So the add-on keeps its own small table, keyed by the same `productKey` the
 * template carries, and a piece it has never heard of falls back to a plain
 * rectangle at the template's own stated size rather than failing to render.
 * That is the seam a real install replaces: the host hands over a product
 * record, this table becomes a lookup, and nothing above it changes.
 *
 * THE COLOURS ARE THE MATERIAL'S, NEVER THE INTERFACE'S. Comp L's one critical
 * colour rule: everything drawn inside the preview uses the piece's own
 * colours, and the only tokens allowed near it are the guide colours — a dashed
 * `--info` outline for a zone being edited, a solid `--danger` outline for one
 * whose content does not fit, a `--pos` flash when a change lands. Nothing in
 * this file is an accent.
