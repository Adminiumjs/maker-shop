 * 24 D7 does not allow — so it works out the reader's language for itself. The
 * one thing every host guarantees is `<html lang>` and `<html dir>`, stamped by
 * its own i18n provider; this module reads that attribute and re-renders when
 * it changes.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` over a `MutationObserver` rather than reading the
 * attribute during render: a host sets `lang` in an effect, so a plain read
 * would be one render behind on every language switch and the add-on's panel
 * would sit in the old language until something else moved it.
 *
 * The same file as the delivery add-on's, which is the point: two add-ons in
 * one repo solving the identical problem the identical way is a convention, and
 * the moment it becomes a third the pair should move into `packages/host`.
