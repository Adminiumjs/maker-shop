/**
 * THE ENGINE (24 D5c). Pure, deterministic, DOM-free.
 *
 * Everything this add-on claims rests on four functions in this file:
 *
 *   `fit`            — does this line go in that area, and if not, what are the
 *                      ways out AND THEIR NUMBERS?
 *   `check`          — the whole personalization against the whole template.
 *   `previewSvg`     — the picture, as bytes, identical for identical values.
 *   `toProductionPaths` — what goes to the laser: cut and engrave geometry,
 *                      with the text already turned into outlines.
 *
 * ── NO CLOCK, NO DICE, NO DOM, NO NETWORK ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not one of them reads `Date.now()`, calls `Math.random()`, touches
 * `document`, or fetches anything. `sources.test.ts` greps for all four. The
 * measuring that comp L did with a canvas is a committed table in `faces.ts`,
 * for the reason set out at the top of that file: a preview measured on the
 * reader's machine is a different preview on a different machine, and criterion
 * 17 asks for the opposite.
 *
 * ── THE PICTURE IS A STRING, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DETERMINISM ARGUMENT ─────
 *
 * `previewSvg` returns SVG source. The shopper's canvas, the basket thumbnail,
 * the proof and the maker's order line all render THE SAME STRING, and
 * `digest` is a hash of exactly those bytes. So "the cart thumbnail, the proof
 * and the order line are the same picture" is not a claim about three renderers
 * agreeing — there is one renderer, it produces text, and the text is compared.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS A VERDICT AND WHAT IS A BLOCK ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `check` returns both, and the split is the reason criterion 18 can be
 * absolute. A VERDICT is about something the shopper typed, so there is always
 * a number to offer: a smaller size, a shorter line, a cut before the character
 * the studio has no letter for. A BLOCK is about something they have NOT typed
 * — a required area still empty — and "shorten it to N characters" is not
 * advice you can give about an empty box. So an empty required area stops "Add
 * to basket" with a plain reason instead, which is what comp L draws, and every
 * verdict without exception carries a remedy with a number in it.

 *
 * The surface used to decide, per verdict code, which buttons a failure gets:
 * one branch per code, each reading whichever field of `CodedVerdict` it
 * happened to know about. Two things follow from that and both were real.
 *
 *   1. A CODE COULD SILENTLY GET FEWER BUTTONS THAN THE ENGINE OFFERED. An
 *      `overrun` carries BOTH remedies (D5c), and the guard asked only whether
 *      the screen had at least one `.lp-remedy` in it. A verifier wrapped the
 *      SIZE button in `false &&`, deleting a working way out for every shopper
 *      whose wording will not fit at any length, and the suite stayed green
 *      because the SHORTEN button still satisfied "more than zero".
 *   2. A NEW CODE GOT NONE AT ALL. `no-letter` split into a swappable half and
 *      a stuck half; the swappable half had no branch, so the engine computed
 *      "we cut ' for ’" and the screen drew a sentence with nothing under it.
 *
 * Both are the same defect: the list of remedies lived in the surface, where no
 * suite could compare it with the engine's. It lives HERE now, `remediesFor` is
 * the only thing that builds it, the surface renders whatever it returns
 * without knowing the codes, and `surfaces.test.tsx` asserts every member
 * reaches the screen CARRYING ITS OWN VALUE. A remedy the engine offers cannot
 * be dropped by the surface any more, because the surface no longer chooses.
 *
 * `swap` is why this is a union rather than a number. `Verdict.remedies` in
 * `product-personalizer@1` carries a size and a character count and nothing
 * else, and "cut this mark instead of that one" is neither — the contract's
 * limit, honestly. So the add-on's own invariant is the stronger one: every
 * failing verdict that is not accompanied by a block has at least one remedy
 * here, whatever kind it is.
