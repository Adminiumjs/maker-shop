/**
 * WHERE A SHOPPER'S CHOICES LIVE BETWEEN THE PIECE'S PAGE AND THE BASKET.
 *
 * The host owns the basket. What it stores per line is a piece, a size, a
 * finish, a quantity and THE SHOPPER'S OWN WORDS — a plain string, because that
 * is what a shop with no add-on connected has and what its empty state is built
 * around (24 D19). A host that had to grow a `personalization` column the
 * moment an add-on arrived would be a host that knows which add-ons exist.
 *
 * So the words stay the host's and the rest is ours, and the two are joined by
 * a key derived from BOTH: the piece and the words. That is not a hack, it is
 * the same content-addressing the picture store uses one file over — two basket
 * lines carrying the same words on the same piece ARE the same personalization,
 * and there is no state to keep in step because there is no identity to lose.
 *
 * What it costs: two lines of the same piece with the same words and different
 * fonts collapse into one. In a shop where the words are a family name and a
 * date that is the right trade; in one where it is not, the host has a column
 * to add and this module has a `lineId` to take instead. The seam does not
 * move.

 *
 * ── WHY IT IS A SECOND MAP AND NOT JUST `chosen` ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `commit` files a picture on every keystroke that leaves the piece makeable,
 * and it has to: `recall` keys a personalization by the shopper's words, so a
 * basket line can only find its picture if the picture was filed under exactly
 * the words the line ended up carrying. The cost is that `chosen` also holds
 * every makeable PREFIX — "The Hartleys" on the way to "The Hartleys · est.
 * 2019" — which is right for a lookup and wrong for a list.
 *
 * The bench sheet is a list, and a maker reading four rows where two pieces are
 * being cut would trust it once and never again. So the sheet reads this map,
 * which is written from `personalizationOf` — the one helper the cart line, the
 * order line and the proof all resolve through, and therefore the only place
 * that means "a line of this shop's actually carries these words".
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE HOST STILL DOES NOT TELL US ITS ORDERS ─────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here reads a reference, a line id or a stage. What is recorded is
 * that SOME line resolved to this personalization, which is a fact about this
 * add-on's own output. `nav.add-on.routes` carries no payload but the settings,
 * and an add-on that listed "today's orders" would be inventing a shop's
 * paperwork — the defect `seed.ts` records against the references that used to
 * live in this package.
 *
 * Writing it from a render is safe and deliberate: the key is the content, so a
 * double render in strict mode sets the same entry twice and changes nothing.

 * THE SIZE NOBODY CHOSE: the largest the studio cuts that the words go in at.

 * a promise that any particular words fit inside it. "The Hartleys · est. 2019"
 * is 86 mm of letters at that default against a 75 mm area, so EVERY seeded
 * order on the bench came back marked as not fitting, and the picture beside it
 * was of words falling off a coaster. Nothing was wrong with those orders. The
 * add-on had simply answered a question the customer never asked, and answered
 * it badly.
 *
 * What a maker actually does with wording and no stated size is cut it as large
 * as it will go, and `fit` already computes that number — it is the same
 * `setSizeMm` remedy the shopper's surface offers as a button, so this is the
 * add-on taking its own advice rather than a second rule invented here.
 *
 * It is a LOOP rather than one pass because a piece has more than one area and
 * they are measured separately: dropping the size for the long line can leave
 * the date fitting where it did not, and could in principle leave another area
 * still over. Each pass strictly lowers the size, so it terminates; four is far
 * more than the two areas any piece here carries, and a wording that still does
 * not fit at the smallest size the studio cuts is one no size can save. Those
 * come back marked, which is the honest answer.
