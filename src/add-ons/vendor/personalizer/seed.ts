 *
 * THIS IS THE ADD-ON'S DATA, NOT THE SHOP'S. A real install reads
 * `personalization_templates` and `personalizations` out of the host's
 * database — the two tables `manifest.json` declares. In the demo they are
 * here, keyed by the same product keys Birch Row uses, which is exactly the
 * `DataSource` seam the example apps use one directory further out: the shape
 * the surfaces read does not change, only where it comes from.
 *
 * NOT ONE ORDER REFERENCE IS IN THIS FILE ANY MORE, and their absence is the
 * point. It used to carry `BR-2281`/`l_5510` — a particular shop's order and
 * line ids — and look personalizations up by them. A reference is a host's own
 * vocabulary; a piece and the customer's own words are not, and that is what
 * every surface here resolves by now (`store.ts`). Nothing below is dated,
 * either: no clock is read anywhere in this package.
 *
 * The four sample personalizations are chosen to be visibly different lengths,
 * because that is what the suites need to prove: one comfortably short, one
 * that overruns and shows the remedies, one in a painted finish rather than
 * engraved, and one on the house sign.

/**
 * WHAT EACH SEEDED PIECE IS CALLED — as a key, exactly like `ANGLE_LABELS`.
 *
 * ── THE SLUG THAT SHIPPED ON A MAKER-FACING SCREEN ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The set-up route drew its two chips from a hard-coded array and rendered the
 * PRODUCT KEY as their body: the live DOM read `walnut-coasters` and
 * `house-sign`, in every one of the eight locales, on a page a maker uses. A
 * machine key is not a name in any language, and rendering one is the same
 * defect as leaving a string untranslated — worse, because it looks like a bug
 * rather than an omission.
 *
 * A `Template` cannot carry the name: its shape is `product-personalizer@1`'s,
 * the contract is frozen, and a display label is not a field it has. So the
 * name lives beside the seed that needs it, as a message key, which is the
 * pattern this file already uses for the angles a piece is photographed from
 * (`ANGLE_LABELS`) and the zones drawn on it.
 *
 * THESE TWO PIECES ARE THIS ADD-ON'S OWN DEMO SEED, not a host's catalogue —
 * the same status as the templates above, and the reason it is allowed to name
 * them at all. A real installation draws its list from the shop's products; a
 * key here with no name is caught by `template.test.ts` rather than falling
 * back to the slug, because falling back to the slug is what this replaced.

/**
 * FOUR SAMPLE PERSONALIZATIONS, chosen for their lengths.
 *
 * ── THEY USED TO CARRY A HOST'S ORDER REFERENCES, AND THAT WAS THE DEFECT ───
 *
 * Each row began `ref: 'BR-2281', lineId: 'l_5510'` — Birch Row's own order
 * reference and its own line id, written down in an add-on's repo — and
 * `lineFor(lineId)` looked a personalization up by one of them. Three things
 * were wrong with it and only the third was visible:
 *
 *   1. IT IS ONE SHOP'S VOCABULARY, exactly like the delivery add-on seeding
 *      the print works' `MP-4126`. A second host has different references, so
 *      the table is dead weight there by construction.
 *   2. IT WAS NEVER TRUE HERE EITHER. Birch Row's `BR-2281` is a bookmark for
 *      Priya; this file claimed it was four walnut coasters for the Hartleys.
 *      Nothing compared them, because nothing could.
 *   3. AND THE CALL SITE PASSED THE WRONG ONE: `lineFor(payload.order.ref)`
 *      handed an ORDER reference to a function matching LINE ids, so the branch
 *      could not match under any data at all. Dead code guarding dead data.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACED IT is the key the basket already used, one module over: a line
 * is found by the PIECE and the CUSTOMER'S OWN WORDS (`store.ts`). Those are
 * fields every host of these surfaces carries — `SlotItem.key` and
 * `SlotItem.note` — so the same lookup works in a shop this add-on has never
 * seen, and a line placed before the add-on was ever connected still resolves,
 * because its words are on it.
 *
 * These four stay because the ENGINE's suite and the CONTRACT's conformance
 * suite need values with known lengths — one comfortable, one in a painted
 * finish rather than engraved, one that overruns and shows both remedies with
 * their numbers, and one on the other piece entirely. A demo in which nothing
 * ever fails cannot show what the failure looks like. They are fixtures now,
 * and nothing at runtime looks anything up in them.
