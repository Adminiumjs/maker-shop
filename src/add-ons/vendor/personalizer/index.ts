/**
 * Live Personalizer — the add-on's registration (24 §8B).
 *
 * `register()` returns the object `@adminium/add-on-host` describes, and that
 * object is the whole public surface: the host's registry indexes it, the
 * dock's toggle flips it on and off, and its six fills are the only places this
 * add-on ever draws. There is no side effect on import — no global, no patched
 * host, no listener — which is what lets a host register it, unregister it, and
 * be back at exactly its base state (D6).
 *
 * `connect: "none"` is the honest answer and it changes what the connect dialog
 * shows: no credential form, no account, one click. The permission list is
 * still explicit, because "it needs nothing" is a claim a shop owner should be
 * able to read rather than infer from an empty form.
